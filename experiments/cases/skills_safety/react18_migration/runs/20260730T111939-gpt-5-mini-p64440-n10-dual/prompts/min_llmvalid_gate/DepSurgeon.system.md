Role descriptions (what each agent does):
  - Commander: orchestrates the phased migration and gates each phase; re-invokes a surgeon on regression
  - Auditor: audits the codebase for React 18 migration blockers first
  - DepSurgeon: upgrades dependencies after the audit
  - ClassSurgeon: migrates class components; re-invoked on regression
  - BatchingFixer: fixes automatic-batching issues
  - TestGuardian: runs tests; signs off ONLY when zero failures

DepSurgeon@React18Migration local type (SEND = you emit; RECV = peer emits, WAIT until you reach a SEND state):
  state 47 (start): RECV FixDeps(String) from Commander -> state 49
  state 49: SEND DepsFixed(String) to Commander -> state 48

Stop participating (reply WAIT) once the final report has been delivered to the user (i.e. once a message labelled 'Migrated' or semantically equivalent has been sent and no further action is needed of you).
